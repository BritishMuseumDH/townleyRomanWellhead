Pentelic marble well-head (puteal) decorated with four scenes of erotic pursuit: Hercules in female dress seizing Omphale, flanked on the left by a vase and on the right by a flying Cupid holding a sceptre; a female figure struggling with a male, thought to resemble Hercules; a female figure seized by a young satyr carrying a wineskin; and a young Hermaphrodite attempting to escape from a bearded satyr, who is seated on a rock under a palm tree.
